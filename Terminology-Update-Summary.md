# Terminology Update Summary

## Changes Made

I've successfully removed "Published Language" terminology from your codebase and replaced it with more standard and descriptive terms:

### 1. Class Rename

- **Before**: `PublishedLanguageMapper`
- **After**: `ApiContractMapper`
- **File**: `src/Infrastructure/Mappers/ApiContractMapper.cs`

### 2. Comments and Documentation Updates

#### API Contract Mapper

- Updated class summary to use "API Contract Mapper" instead of "Published Language Mapper"
- Changed method comments to reference "external API" instead of "published language"
- Updated parameter descriptions to use "API contract" terminology

#### Endpoints

- **CreateOrderEndpoint**: Changed from "Published Language Endpoint" to "API Endpoint"
- **GetOrderEndpoint**: Changed from "Published Language Endpoint" to "API Endpoint"
- Updated all logging messages to use "external API" instead of "published language"
- Updated endpoint descriptions in Swagger documentation

#### Contracts

- **GetOrderResponse**: Changed from "Published Language: Response" to "API Contract: Response"

#### Validators

- **CreateOrderRequestValidator**: Updated to reference "external API" instead of "published language"

#### Configuration Files

- **Program.cs**: Updated FastEndpoints configuration comments
- **ServiceExtensions.cs**: Updated service registration comments

## Rationale for Changes

### Why "API Contract" is Better Than "Published Language"

1. **Clarity**: "API Contract" is immediately understood by developers as the stable interface between systems
2. **Industry Standard**: More commonly used terminology in modern software development
3. **Self-Documenting**: The name clearly indicates its purpose without requiring DDD knowledge
4. **Practical Focus**: Emphasizes the practical aspect of maintaining API stability

### What These Terms Mean

- **API Contract**: The stable interface that external clients depend on
- **External API**: The public-facing HTTP endpoints that clients interact with
- **API Contract Mapper**: The translation layer between external contracts and internal models

## Technical Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clearer naming makes the code easier to understand and maintain
2. **Onboarding**: New developers can understand the purpose without DDD background
3. **Documentation**: More self-documenting code reduces need for extensive comments
4. **Industry Alignment**: Uses terminology consistent with REST API and microservices patterns

## Build Status

âœ… **All changes compile successfully** - The project builds without errors after the terminology updates.

The codebase now uses standard, clear terminology while maintaining all the same architectural benefits and patterns.
