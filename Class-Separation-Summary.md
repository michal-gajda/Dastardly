# Class Separation Summary

## Overview

Successfully separated all classes into individual files following single responsibility principle and clean architecture guidelines.

## Files Created/Reorganized

### 1. Contracts (API Definitions)

```text
Before: OrderContracts.cs (3 classes in one file)
After:
  ├── CreateOrderRequest.cs      # Order creation request contract
  ├── CreateOrderResponse.cs     # Order creation response contract  
  ├── GetOrderResponse.cs        # Order query response contract (NEW)
  └── ErrorResponse.cs          # Standard error response contract
```

### 2. Validators (Request Validation)

```text
Before: Validator class embedded in CreateOrderEndpoint.cs
After:
  └── CreateOrderRequestValidator.cs  # Separated validation logic
```

### 3. Endpoints (FastEndpoints Implementation)

```text
Already separated:
  ├── CreateOrderEndpoint.cs    # POST /api/orders (cleaned up)
  └── GetOrderEndpoint.cs      # GET /api/orders/{id} (improved)
```

### 4. Mappers (Translation Layer)

```text
Already appropriate:
  └── PublishedLanguageMapper.cs  # Single focused class
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

- Each file now contains exactly one class
- Clear naming convention: file name = class name
- Focused purpose per file

### 2. **Better Contract Design**

- `GetOrderResponse`: More comprehensive than reusing `CreateOrderResponse`
- Specific contracts for specific operations
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. **Improved Maintainability**

- Easy to locate specific functionality
- Cleaner imports and dependencies
- Better IDE support and navigation
- Simpler unit testing

### 4. **Enhanced Scalability**

- Easy to add new contracts without cluttering existing files
- Clear pattern for future endpoints and validators
- Modular structure supports team development

## Directory Structure (Final)

```text
Infrastructure/PublishedLanguage/
├── Contracts/
│   ├── CreateOrderRequest.cs      # 15 lines - Order creation request
│   ├── CreateOrderResponse.cs     # 22 lines - Order creation response
│   ├── GetOrderResponse.cs        # 36 lines - Order query response
│   └── ErrorResponse.cs           # 22 lines - Error response
├── Endpoints/
│   ├── CreateOrderEndpoint.cs     # 73 lines - Create order endpoint
│   └── GetOrderEndpoint.cs        # 51 lines - Get order endpoint
├── Validators/
│   └── CreateOrderRequestValidator.cs # 21 lines - Request validation
├── PublishedLanguageMapper.cs     # 57 lines - Domain translation
└── README.md                      # Documentation
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Developer Experience**: Faster navigation and comprehension
2. **Code Reviews**: Easier to review focused changes
3. **Testing**: Simpler to write targeted unit tests
4. **Maintenance**: Clearer responsibility boundaries
5. **Team Collaboration**: Reduced merge conflicts
6. **Documentation**: Self-documenting through structure

This reorganization follows industry best practices and aligns with Domain-Driven Design principles for published language implementation.
